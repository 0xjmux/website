		<p>&nbsp;</p>


		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>Free and Open Source</h4>
				<p>
					BookStack is 100% free to use under the MIT license.
					The code is fully open; Use and modify BookStack any way you
					like, just provide attribution if you distribute the code.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>Self-Host However You Please</h4>
				<p>
					There's no push to the cloud here unless that's your preference.
					Whether you install on a Raspberry Pi, or stick it in AWS; It's fully up to you.
					You can ensure your documentation stays behind your firewall.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>Lightweight and Speedy</h4>
				<p>
					Tired of seeing placeholder content while your pages load? Tired of managing bloated Java processes? BookStack is built in modern PHP and can run on lightweight systems.

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>WYSIWYG Editing Experience</h4>
				<p>
					BookStack uses a WYSWIYG editor at it's core, with a range of essential formatting options and features. No scary mark-up language. Ideal for mixed-skill environments.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>Standard Content Storage Format</h4>
				<p>
					BookStack primarily retains content in a relatively focused and flat layer of HTML. One of our ideals is to keep the format relatively standardised for if you ever need to migrate away from BookStack.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>System API</h4>
				<p>
					Our growing REST API allows the programming of automation where desired, and provides a mechanism for import where needed.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>An Open Community</h4>
				<p>
					Whether it's via GitHub, Discord or our subreddit, you can discuss with and seek help from the BookStack developers & the wider community.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>Diagrams.net Integration, Built In</h4>
				<p>
					Want to create diagrams in your documentation? You can jump directly into an embedded <a href="https://www.diagrams.net/">diagrams.net</a> editing
					session which will save directly into BookStack.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h4>Authentication Options</h4>
				<p>
					A range of authentication options and controls are built-in including LDAP, SAML2 and a range of OAuth clients. Additionally MFA with role-based enforcement can be used with any of these.

		<h2>Migrating From Confluence to BookStack</h2>

		<p class="margin-bottom large">
			We don't yet have an automated way to migrate your content directly from Confluence to BookStack. <br>
			We do have a growing REST API that can be used to automate some of the process where possible. <br>
			In the future we'd like to have some tools to assist with a migration but the opportunity <br> to create such tools has not yet presented itself.
