### Arabic and Right-to-Left Text Support

This release brings quite a notable addition to BookStack's language support. Thanks to [@kmoj86](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/pull/945) Arabic is now a language choice. This is the first right-to-left language in BookStack so some functionality has been added to support right-to-left text.

The WYSIWYG editor will now default it's text direction based on your language setting. In addition, If a right-to-left language is in use then additional toolbar options will show to provide control over text direction:

Styles to bullet-points have been updated to ensure they display correctly when displayed in a RTL manner and page content should show in the correct direction depending on the text detected within.

Note, Right-to-left text support is in its early stages so there's likely to be further updates needed. Please feel free to raise any issues found on GitHub.

### Next Steps

As mentoined above, The Bookshelves implementation has been functionality focused for this release so I'll be thinking about how to bring in a unique Bookshelf design to make them more effective in use. I'm sure we'll also see some further thoughts and requests as people start to use Bookshelves.  

To support the implemented, but not documented, themeing system I'd like to revamp and clean-up all views used by the system. This would probably tie in with fleshing-out the Bookshelf design work as part of a bigger design update which also enhances mobile support.

To support future back-end features such as notifications, exports and API support I'd like to refactor a chunk of the existing code that deals with shelves, books, pages & chapters to make such future developments easier. This will probably be my own focus for the next couple of weeks.
